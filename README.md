Welcome to the repository for my Summer 2025 internship at Brainwave Matrix Solution. This document serves as a comprehensive overview of my journey, the projects I contributed to, the skills I developed, and my key takeaways from this valuable experience.

# ðŸš€ Introduction
This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to join the innovative team at Brainwave Matrix Solution as a Cybersecurity Intern. My primary focus is on developing security tools and analyzing potential threats to enhance the company's defensive capabilities.

This internship is an immersive experience that will allow me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world cybersecurity challenges, collaborate with talented professionals, and contribute to meaningful security projects.


ðŸ“‚ Projects
Below is a summary of the key projects I was involved in during my internship.

<details>
<summary><h3>Task 1: Phishing Link Scanner using Python</h3></summary>

Description: The goal of this project is to develop a tool in Python that can analyze URLs to detect potential phishing attempts. The scanner will check for common characteristics of malicious links, such as suspicious keywords, URL shortening, and domain age, to flag them as safe or unsafe.

My Role & Contributions:

Develop the core scanning logic in Python.

Research and integrate various threat intelligence APIs to check URLs against known blacklists.

Design and implement algorithms to identify deceptive patterns in URLs.

Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) for users to input links for analysis.

Outcome: The initial goal is to create a functional prototype that can accurately identify a high percentage of phishing links from a test dataset.
